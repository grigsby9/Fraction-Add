# Fraction-Add 

This project aims to provide a program that prompts for two fractions, adds them, and displays the sum with the lowest common denominator. 

## Initial Objective

Write a program that asks the user for two fractions, adds them, and displays the result so that the numerator and denominator have no common factor. For example, when adding 3/4 and 5/6, the result is 19/12. Use helper methods for obtaining the numerator and denominator of strings such as "3/4" from the user, and for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.
